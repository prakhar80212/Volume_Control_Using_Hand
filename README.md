Volume Control Using Hand Detection
This project uses hand detection to control the volume of your system using a webcam. By measuring the distance between the tips of your thumb and index finger, the system dynamically adjusts the volume.

Features
Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe
Volume control based on the distance between thumb and index finger
Web interface to start and stop video feed
Technologies Used
Python
Flask
OpenCV
MediaPipe
Pycaw (Python Core Audio Windows Library)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/volume-control-hand-detection.git
cd volume-control-hand-detection
Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the Flask application:

bash
python app.py
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

The video feed will start, and you can control the volume by adjusting the distance between your thumb and index finger.

Files
app.py: Main application file
templates/index.html: HTML template for the web interface
How It Works
Hand Detection: Uses MediaPipe to detect hands in the video feed.
Landmark Extraction: Extracts landmarks of the hand and identifies the positions of the thumb and index finger.
Volume Control: Calculates the distance between the tips of the thumb and index finger, then maps this distance to the system volume range using Pycaw.
Routes
/: Main page displaying the video feed.
/video_feed: Endpoint to provide the video feed.
/stop_stream: Endpoint to stop the video feed.
Important Notes
This project is intended for educational purposes and may require adjustments based on your system configuration and environment.
Ensure you have a working webcam for the video feed.
